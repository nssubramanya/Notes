## Management by Walking around

## Code of Ethics

## Google: 5 Keys to a Successful Google Team
1. __Psychological Safety__ - Can we take risks on this team
2. __Dependability__ - Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
3. __Structure & Clarity__ - Are goals, roles and execution plans on our team clear?
4. __Meaning of Work__ - Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
5. __Impact of Work__ - Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters?


## Psychological Safety
- People don't take risks when they don't feel safe
- If thought of stepping forward creates sense of danger, most people think twice

### My Experiences
* If somebody comes up with a problem, the problem is dumped on them to solve. Though this stems from "Think of a solution before posing a problem", people will shudder from highlighting problems for which they don't no solution. Others might know!!

* Strange looks when somebody says "I don't understand or asks you to repeat etc."
* One of your previous failure or bad incident is brought up to silence you
* Person keeps bringing up old failures or issues
* If you ask too many probing or realistic questions, you are branded a nay-sayer
* 

* Vulnerability isn't held against you
	- Colleagues judging others for mistakes or wrong decisions. Sets in "Fear of Judgement"
	- Blame game & Finger pointing	
* Contribution and Mutual Respect
	- Awareness of contributions of other team members
	- Team members who don't respect each other will be less likely to be vulnerable (admit mistakes)
	
* Learning is the goal
	- Does team believe learning and constant improvement is the goal?

	
## Strategies to avoid being Judged
Ignorant - Don't ask Questions
Incompetent - Don't admit weakness or mistake
Intrusive - Don't offer Ideas
Negative - Don't critique the Status Quo

This works for "Self Protection" and is called as "Impression Management"

Everytime we withhold, we rob ourselves and our colleagues of small moments of learnng & we don't innovate

**Defn: Psychological Safety**
_It is a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes_

Teams need to actively talk about errors and mistakes, admitting mistakes, not finger pointing but trying to find out how to fix those errors.
Learning: Blame nobody. Find the root cause, (Not the person, the cause) and put a process to fix it!

### Strategies to overcome
#### STOP behavior that discourages people to speak up
What! Don't you know that much?
How dumb? That's a stupid idea
That will never work!
Do you even know what you are talking about?
How could you make this mistake?

Don't send this mail/report without my permission!
Go! Go! Go! Get Cracking!!!
How many times should I correct you?
Just do as I say!
I knew you will make this mistake...
Here's the culprit who broke the build!!!
What a silly question!
I will get a beating from Customer/management because of your mistakes!


## 3 Simple things to bring in 
1. Make the project/task as a learning problem not an execution problem. We have not done this before and there is enormous interdependence
2. Acknowledge your own fallibility
3. Model curiosity, ask a lot of questions 

Comfort Zone - High Safety, Low Accountability
Apathy Zone - Low Safety, Low Accountability (Dont' care)
Anxiety Zone - Low Safety, High Accountability
Learning/Performance Zone - High Safety, High Accountability
