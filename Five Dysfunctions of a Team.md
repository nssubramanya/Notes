## Characters of a Dysfunctional Team
### Absence of Trust
_"Trust is the foundation of real teamwork. So, the first dysfunction is a failure on the part of team members to understand and open up to one another"_

_"Great teams do not hold back with one another. They are unafraid to air their dirty laundry. They admit their mistakes, their weakness and their concerns without **fear of reprisal.**"_

## Dysfucntion #1: Absence of Trust
### What is trust?

### How to people trust one another?

### What creates "absence of trust"?
* When I determine other person is not Understanding/ Has failed to understand
	- Not listening actively
	- Not acting even after listening
	- Not showing sincerety in follow through
* When I don't open up to others
	- Other person has tendency to use information out of context
	- 
* When I determine that other person is not accepting their mistakes
	- Other person does not believe it is a mistake
	- Difference is interpretation of seriousness of mistake
	- Person repeats mistake again and again
	- Person is not putting enough effort to correct the mistake
* Respect
	- Do I know enough about the person to respect them?
* Say-Do Ratio
	- Says something and does something else

### What are the behavior indications of "absence of trust"?
* Lack of passionate discussions and debate in meetings
* Lack of interactions among team
* People giving feedback that there is "lack of trust" or some people or not trust-worthy

### Why is trust important for success?
* Every effective team has a substantial level of debate

### What happens when there is trust-deficit?
* Morale problems, Inefficiency
* FEAR of CONFLICT

### Does lack of debate a good indicator of trust deficit?
Only if everybody is on same page, working in lockstep towards same goals, no confusion.

### Why people don't argue/debate?
* Lack of time - NO
* __People are not comfortable challenging each other__
* Meetings are Pretty Dull
* Meetings are too full
* People don't agree on anything but still don't challenge others and have concerns !!

### Cause of Trust-deficit and How to trust people?
* _"Teamwork begins by building trust. Only way to do it is to **Overcome our need for INVLUNERABILITY**"_
* Demonstrate VULNERABILITY in a Low Risk but Relevant Way

#### Exercise: 
What do you belive is the single biggest strength and weakness in terms of your contribution to Company's Success or failure?

**Examples**

_Strengths_

* Ability to see through fluffy, superflous information and cut the point that matters. Eliminate un-necessary details and get to heart of issue - Saves lot of time
* Lack of fear when it comes to negotiation
* Vendor/Competitor management - get them to do more than what they want to do

* Amazing networking skills & build partnerships with investors and partners
* Follow-through
* Doing shit-work and not complain
_Weakness_

* Conservative in finances by being very controlling
* Afraid to fail - tend to over-engineer things - Don't delegate - hence surely fail

## Deeper Behavior Analysis
There are lot of Diagnostic Tools that help in analyzing one's personality type.
Introvert Vs Extrovert etc.

### Importance
Implications of Personality Style preferences and collective opportunities/threats/challenges those styles create

### Interpersonal Styles and Team Behaviors
**TODO**

### MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)


## Dysfunction #2: Fear of Conflict
_"If we don't trust one another, we are not going to engage in open, constructive, ideological conflict. We will just continue to preserve a sense of ARTIFICIAL HARMONY"_

* Passive, sarcastic comments are not CONFLICT. 
* Artificial Harmony comes from People holding back their opinions and honest concerns. 
* Frustrations are bottled up and carried around

## Dysfunction #3: Lack of Commitment
_"Lack of Commitment and failure to buy in to decisions. Evidence of this is AMBIGUITY"_

Committing to a plan or decision and getting everyone to clearly buy in to it. Conflict is important to get the buy-in. 

If consensus comes about naturally and quickly, its great. "Consensus SHOULD NOT become and attempt to please everybody"

EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE, IF DECISION IS MADE, YOU HAVE TO "COMMIT". 

## Dysfunction #4: Avoidance of Accountability
_"Once we achieve clarity and buy-in, it is then that we have to hold each other accountable for what we sign-up to do, for high standards of performance and behavior.

### Difficulty of holding people accountable
And as simple as it sounds, most executives hate to do it, especially when it come to a peer's behavior, because they want to avoid interpersonal discomfort"_

"Some people are hard to hold accountable because they are so helpful. Others because they get defensive. Others because they are intimidating."

### How to hold people accountable
* Holding people accountable IS NOT LACK OF TRUST.
* Trust is not assuming that everybody is on the same page and they don't need to be pushed.
* Trust is knowing that when a team member does push you, the're doing it because they care about the team!!!
* Push with Respect, and under the assumption that the other person is probably doing the right thing. But push anyway, don't hold back.

## Dysfunction #5: Inattention to Results
_"The tendency of team members to seek-out individual recognition and attention at the expense of results i.e. collective results or goals of entire team"_

### Cause
Status & Ego

### Analysis
* Everyone is focussing on achieving their individual results
* Even if one person or set of people achieve result, but IF TEAM LOSES, EVERYONE LOSES.
* People focussed on individual results are not bothered about team success or failure. They are only bothered about their results and publicity they get out of that.
* This will cause major Recognition issues. Team members will feel de-motivated and inturn lose trust and respect.
* This stems from NEED of Recognition for the person. Maybe in childhood, the person has longed for recongnition and is not willing to let it go. Person has become Selfish, may be due to low confidence.


### Solutions
* Make Collective Ego greater than Individual ones
* If you have such individual attraction suckers, Bench them/Ignore them. Some of them MIGHT correct their attitude! Either they Quit or they will come back stronger.
* Leader's Job is to create the best possible team and not shephard careers of individuals
* Make Collective Results as important as Score in a Football game! No room for interpretation and individual ego's to sneak in.
* __Define Goals and Results in a way that is simple engough to grasp easily and specific enough to be actionable__

### Goals/Result Categories/Metrics
* Revenue
* Expenses
* New Customer Acquisition
* Current Customer Satisfaction
* Employee Retention
* Market Awareness
* Product Quality

### Political Organization
* _"Politics is when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they really think"_

## Suggestions
### Moments of Truth are best handled face-to-face
When CTO did not take explicit permission to skip 1.5 days of Retreat in wake of Customer meet, CEO decided to speak with him instead of shooting a reply to mail.

### ACT on Single highest Priority
Single highest priority of company is to get the ACT together. Nothing is more important

### Getting ACT together
If company can't get act together, they are doomed!

### Importance of Connects
CEO was in touch with CEO of customer on another board!
Extremely important to be in touch with peers 
Important to be on boards of companies

### Accommodate personal schedules for meetings with Direct reports sometimes
Lunch with direct reports

### Assess Competitors
* How is their Executive Team?
* How is their product, brand etc?
* Compare competitors on every count - You should be able to do that
* Revenue, Customer Growth etc...

### Appriciate people before repremand
* Acknowledge people for what they have done
* Repremand for what they have missed

### Know your Metrics
* What metrics are you measuring?
* What are measures of success, failure, just scraping through
* What are the goals?

### Set Ground-rules for everything, including meetings

### Meeting Ground-rules
* Attendees MUST be Physically & Mentally Present
* Attendees MUST PARTICIPATE
* Attendees MUST be fully engaged in what is being discussed about
* Peope must speak-up when team time is being wasted
* Speak-up with things that can be handled One-On-One is discussed in Meetings
* Don't use Computer/Mobile to take notes - easy to assume that they are doing something else. **This is more Behavioral issue than Technical One**

### Ice-breaking Questions in Teams
* 5 questions about childhood - Hometown, Number of kids, Family, Childhood hobbies, Biggest challenge growing up, First job
* Tell something intersting that others don't know about
* Mild-Personal Disclosure 

### Mild-Personal disclosure leads to tighter teams
* Team members may not know about others well
* There are lot of points that help us respect others - their education, goals, dreams, challenges, struggles etc.
* Team building Events are ideal for getting this
* Ex: What do you respect other one for? What is one special thing you have noticed? What do you envy about the other?

### Everyone Likes to Learn-about and Talk about themselves - Until the criticism comes

### Focus on Body Language

### Strengths and Weaknesses are Rooted in the same things
There is a fine line and strength not limited by boundaries will become a weakness.

### Team-Work: Find out if people are Team-players
* Find out if candidates are team players
* Have candidates participated in team sports or Team building/organization etc.? What was their experience
* What did team-work teach them?

### Team: One-for-All and All-for-one
* Instances where team members were moved between teams to achieve goal that was in jeopardy
* Meeting discipline in Reviewing Goals in Detail and Drilling down on What goals were not met and why
