# Unit Testing & Code Coverage

## Aim of Test Coverage
* Useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase
* Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statements of how good tests are - Ex: 87% or 90% or 100%

## What to Test

* All Exception Paths


## What can be skipped
* Simple Getter/Setters
* 
## Coverage
* 60-80%


## Aspects
* Coverage < 50% is concerning
* General expectation is upper 80% or 90%
* Do what is sufficient


### Thumb Rules
* Are you getting bugs that escape into production?
* Are you hesitant to change some code for fear that it will cause production bugs?
