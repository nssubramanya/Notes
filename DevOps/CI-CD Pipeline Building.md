# CI/CD Pipeline Building

# Continuous Integration

* Development Practice
* Developers integrate code in to shared repo several times a day
* Each check-in is verified by Automated Build
* 

# Continuous Delivery

# Continuous Deployment

# Continuous Testing

# Advantages of CI
* Prevent/shorten Integration problems
* Prevent code-out-of-repository issues
* Checkins are always tested
* Testing in Production-like evironment. Avoids local success and production fail scenarios
* Increases transparency and accountability in the team
* Make developers more reponsible, helps build their confidence

# Key Principles/Practices of CI
* Revision Control - Maintain single source repository
* Frequent Commits
* Code Consolidation
* Build Automation - Automate the build
* Static Code Analysis, Code Coverage Analysis
* Every build should build on Integration machine
* Fast Builds - Keep the build fast
* Self Testing Builds - Make the build Self-testing
* Automated Deployment - Automate Deployment
* Testing in a Clone of Production
* Build Availability - Make it easy for anyone to get latest executable version
* Test Result Availability - Everyone can see what's happening

## Repository Structure to enable CI/CD
## Developer testing - before checkin
## Static Code Analysis
## Code Review - Peer Review etc.
## Developer Unit Testing
## CI Server Infrastructure - Servers for Building and Testing
* Build Servers
* Binary Repositories, How to remove old un-used/broken builds
* Build Versioning
* 
## Build Automation
